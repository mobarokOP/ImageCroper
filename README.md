# Usage

*For a working implementation, please have a look at the Sample Project - sample*


1. Include the library as a local library project.

	```
	allprojects {
	   repositories {
	      jcenter()
	      maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
	   }
	}
	```

    ```  implementation 'com.github.mobarokOP:ImageCroper:1.1' ``` - lightweight general solution

2. Add UCropActivity into your AndroidManifest.xml

    ```
    <activity
        android:name="com.yalantis.ucrop.UCropActivity"
        android:screenOrientation="portrait"
        android:theme="@style/Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar"/>
    ```

3. The uCrop configuration is created using the builder pattern.

   ```java
   UCrop.of(sourceUri, destinationUri)
       .withAspectRatio(16, 9)
       .withMaxResultSize(maxWidth, maxHeight)
       .start(context);
   ```

4. Override `onActivityResult` method and handle uCrop result.

    ```java
    @Override
    public void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
        if (resultCode == RESULT_OK && requestCode == UCrop.REQUEST_CROP) {
            final Uri resultUri = UCrop.getOutput(data);
        } else if (resultCode == UCrop.RESULT_ERROR) {
            final Throwable cropError = UCrop.getError(data);
        }
    }
    ```

5. You may want to add this to your PROGUARD config:

    ```
    -dontwarn com.yalantis.ucrop**
    -keep class com.yalantis.ucrop** { *; }
    -keep interface com.yalantis.ucrop** { *; }
    ```

# Customization

If you want to let your users choose crop ratio dynamically, just do not call `withAspectRatio(x, y)`.

uCrop builder class has method `withOptions(UCrop.Options options)` which extends library configurations.

Currently, you can change:

   * image compression format (e.g. PNG, JPEG), compression
   * image compression quality [0 - 100]. PNG which is lossless, will ignore the quality setting.
   * whether all gestures are enabled simultaneously
   * maximum size for Bitmap that is decoded from source Uri and used within crop view. If you want to override the default behaviour.
   * toggle whether to show crop frame/guidelines
   * setup color/width/count of crop frame/rows/columns
   * choose whether you want rectangle or oval(`options.setCircleDimmedLayer(true)`) crop area
   * the UI colors (Toolbar, StatusBar, active widget state)
   * and more...
